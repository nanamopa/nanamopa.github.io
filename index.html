<p>tropical digital marketing</p>

<p> wacamaia, tropical digital marketing, is a Miami-based agency started by three best friends with a lot of talent and big dreams. We met at the University of Miami where we all studied Marketing in the school of business with different concentrations. Waki1 focused on International Business, Waki2 in Accounting, and Waki3 in Neuromarketing. All latinas, and fully comfortable in the bilingual mess that is Miami, we are ready to serve both LATAM and the US market. </p>
